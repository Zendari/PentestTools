# PentestTools
Complete Installation of Pen-testing tools such as Metasploit

How to Install 
Download the .deb file,
Then install with

dpkg -i metasploit-full-install_1.0.3_all.deb

Then in a terminal run ' Install_Ubuntu' and hit enter! 
Enjoy!

When Installation is done go to /opt/metasploit-framework/ and then enter ./msfconsole to run msfconsole, of course ./msfXXXXX also works.

If Install fails try to run :
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
Then run again Install_Ubuntu

If it still doesnt work try to do : rvm install ruby-2.3.1 
gem install bundler
cd/opt/metasploit-framework 
bundle install
